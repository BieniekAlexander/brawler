# Introduction
I'm messing around with Unity, trying to build a game for the fun of it.

## Design
In brief, I really enjoyed [Battlerite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504370/Battlerite/) and would like to build a similar game with stronger movement and technical mechanics. At the time of this writing, you can see my scratch notes of a Game Design Document [here](https://hickory-bamboo-ea4.notion.site/Brawler-48147dfaabd54280aad6ffeda98289f1?pvs=4).
