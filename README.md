# Introduction
I'm messing around with Unity, trying to build a game for the fun of it.

## Design
In brief, I really enjoyed [Battlerite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504370/Battlerite/) and would like to build a similar game with stronger movement and technical mechanics. At the time of this writing, you can see my scratch notes of a Game Design Document [here](https://hickory-bamboo-ea4.notion.site/Brawler-48147dfaabd54280aad6ffeda98289f1?pvs=4).


# Development
## Initializing Project in Unity
- [Setting Up an Existing Repo in Unity](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71301724/3600382)

## Development Workflow
Check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM) to get started with the development loop.

## Gameplay Testing
See [this page](https://www.notion.so/User-Guide-13b5559be997807d820df800483112d1) in my GDD. To run testing locally: The stage in which I'm doing most tinkering is [Temple Summit](Assets\Scenes\TempleSummit.unity) - load and run it to test!

For testing, I've also provided the following additional controls:
- Numpad Asterisk (*) - switch to other character
- Some other stuff that I can't remember now - see [SceneController.cs](Assets\Scenes\SceneController.cs)
