# Introduction
I'm messing around with Unity, trying to build a game for the fun of it.

## Design
In brief, I really enjoyed [Battlerite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504370/Battlerite/) and would like to build a similar game with stronger movement and technical mechanics. At the time of this writing, you can see my scratch notes of a Game Design Document [here](https://hickory-bamboo-ea4.notion.site/Brawler-48147dfaabd54280aad6ffeda98289f1?pvs=4).


# Development
## Initializing Project in Unity
[See documentation here!](https://unityatscale.com/unity-version-control-guide/how-to-setup-unity-project-on-github/)

## Installing Packages
Some of the packages that I'm using in this project aren't easily accessible with the Unity package manager - see the packages listed below:
- https://github.com/pshtif/RuntimeTransformHandle
    - [Zip available here](https://github.com/DA-LAB-Tutorials/YouTube-Unity-Tutorials/tree/main)
    - Unzip the file somewhere onto your machine and import it into your project [as described here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html)

## Development Workflow
